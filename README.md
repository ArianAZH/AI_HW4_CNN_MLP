In this exercise, which involves multi-class classification using MLP and CNN neural networks, all the necessary steps for implementing and comparing the performance of these two models have been carried out. Due to extensive trial and error, the exercise has been completed in accordance with the assignment requirements.

Various CNN architectures with different characteristics have been designed over the course of a week. This report explains the reasons behind the differences in outcomes and presents improved results from different models.

All results are available inside the file hw4.ipynb in both .py and .ipynb formats. Considering the thorough evaluation, the exercise has been run multiple times with different hyperparameter settings.

Although the final results presented in the report correspond to the most recent efforts, they show improvement over earlier versions. All training phases, including the extended training periods, have been summarized. Complete visualizations and model evaluation diagrams are also included.
